# Exercise 2

This is an ungraded, optional exercise.

In the example from Lecture 2, we implemented a class `Circle` that implements two interfaces `GeometricShape` and `Printable`.  For this exercise,

1. Implement another class `Square` that implements the two interfaces.  You may have to extend the class `Point` you wrote for Exercise 1 to implement the methods in Square.

2. Implement another class `PaintedSquare` that implements the two interfaces and inherits from `PaintedShape`.

3. Implement the methods `equals()` in `Square`, overriding the two methods in the `Object` class, so that `equals()` semantically compare two `Square` objects.
