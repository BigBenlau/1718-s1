# CS2030 Programming Methodology II

## About
This module is a follow up to CS1010.  It explores two modern programming paradigms, object-oriented programming and functional programming.  Through a series of integrated assignments, students will learn to develop medium-scale software programs in the order of thousands of lines of code and tens of classes using object-oriented design principles and advanced programming constructs available in the two paradigms.  Topics include objects and classes, composition, association, inheritance, interface, polymorphism, abstract classes, dynamic binding, lambda expression, effect-free programming, first class functions, closures, continuations, monad, etc.  

## Who/When/Where

* Lecture: 10am - 12noon, every Monday
* Venue: LT19
* Instructor: [Ooi Wei Tsang](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ooiwt)
* Teaching Assistant: Kenneth Lu
* Lab: Every Thursday (Week 3 - Week 13)

## Workload

Besides the 4-hour contact time for lecture and lab, students are expected to spend about 6 hours on average weekly on homework and on preparing the class.

## History

CS2030 is a new module, required for all students in Bachelor of Computing (Computer Science) and Second Major in Computer Science students, cohort 17/18 onwards.  In 2017, the Department of Computer Science reorganized the two module series on data structures and algorithms (CS1020, CS2010) into (CS2030, CS2040).  CS2040 focuses on data structures and algorithms, while the advanced programming methodologies from CS1020 are moved into CS2030.  CS2030 will also covers some basics OO design that previously were covered in CS2103, and introduces students to functional programming, concurrent programming, event-based programming, and other paradigms that are increasingly important.

## Academic Honesty

NUS and School of Computing have a high standard on academic honesty and take any violation seriously.  In the context of computing modules, source code plagiarism -- copying code from another source and attributing it as one's own code -- is a common violation.   Please read the page [Preventing Plagiarism](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cug/plagiarism) from the school's website to familiarize yourself with the policy.

## Textbook

There is no textbook for this class.

There are many good books and online articles written about the topics covered in the module.  These will be listed under the [Readings](readings.md) section.
