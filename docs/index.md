Many of you are starting a new and exciting journey at NUS.  Congratulations, and welcome to NUS Computing!

You are looking at the main website for CS2030.  This is where you will get all of your module information (labs, lecture notes, etc).  

There are two other websites that we will use regularly over the course of the semester:

- [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/j63m6jbocil42), which we will use for Q&A, and
- [IVLE](https://ivle.nus.edu.sg/v1/Module/Student/Default.aspx?CourseID=A55753B4-E2D8-4A3F-A75C-573BB85BF18B), which we will use for [grade dissemination](https://ivle.nus.edu.sg/v1/Gradebook/Staff/gradebook.aspx?CourseID=a55753b4-e2d8-4a3f-a75c-573bb85bf18b&eu=dcsooiwt), [class roster](https://ivle.nus.edu.sg/v1/ClassManagement/Student/default.aspx?CourseID=a55753b4-e2d8-4a3f-a75c-573bb85bf18b), etc.

Here are some things that you can read on this site, before the first class:

- [Assumed prior knowledge](prereqs.md): What we expect you to know before the class, from CS1010 or its equivalent;
- [Some readings for 1st year students](readings.md): Useful for senior students as well;
- And, if you feel up for it, [the notes for Lecture 1](lec1/)

Already have a question?  Ask us over at [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/j63m6jbocil42)!
