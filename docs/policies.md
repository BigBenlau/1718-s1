# Policies

## Email Communication

* Please use only your official NUS email for communication with the teaching staffs -- either the one with `@u.nus.edu` or `@comp.nus.edu.sg`.  

* Please use email only for private matters.  Prefix your email subject with `[CS2030]`.

* Please use [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/j63m6jbocil42) for other matters related to the module.  If you email us privately and we feel that your questions/answers are useful to the rest of the class, we will publish it on Piazza, with anonymization when appropriate.

## Lab Sessions

* We do take attendance during the lab sessions, but it does not affect your grades if you do not attend the lab sessions as long as you still need to submit the graded lab exercises.  

* You should stick to your allocated time slot for labs.  If there is a strong reason for your to attend another lab session, please inform your lab instructors.

## Late Submissions

* All graded exercise must be submitted on time.  If you need an extension, please ask for one and provide a justification for approval.  

* For late submission, there is a 1% penalty (of the assessment grade) for every minute after the deadline, capped at 80%.  For example, if a homework is deserved 40 marks, and it is submitted 20 minutes after the deadline, the student will get 32 marks instead (20% penalty).  If it is submitted 2 hours after the deadline, the student will get 8 marks (as it has hit the cap of 80% penalty).

## Discussions and Plagiarism

* We encourage discussions among students for lab assignments, but each student should be responsible for writing his/her own code and should give credits to others when appropriate.  

* Plagiarism of answers is a serious offense in the university, and both parties, the student who copied, and the student who allowed others to copy, will be penalized equally.
