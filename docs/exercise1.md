# Exercise 1

This is an ungraded, optional exercise.

In the example from Lecture 1, we implemented a class `Circle`.  There, we store and pass around two `double` variables that corresponds to the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of a point.  The code would be neater if we create a second class `Point` that encapsulates the concept of a point on 2D plane and the operations on points.

Implement a new class `Point` and modify the class `Circle` to use the class `Point`.  Pay attention to what methods and fields (if any) you expose as `public` outside of the abstraction barrier of a `Point` object.

You will need to use `jshell` from Java 1.9 (or JDK 9) to interact with your new classes.
